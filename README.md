## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile follows an iterative and flexible approach, allowing for continuous feedback, incremental development, and adaptability to changing requirements. It emphasizes collaboration, frequent testing, and small, functional releases, making it ideal for dynamic projects with evolving needs. However, Agile requires close teamwork, making it challenging for projects with strict regulatory constraints. In contrast, Waterfall follows a sequential, linear process where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. It is best suited for well-defined projects with fixed requirements, as it provides clear structure and documentation. However, its rigidity makes it difficult to accommodate changes, and testing only occurs after development, increasing the risk of costly fixes. 


Agile Methodology
 Advantages:
•	Adaptable to changing requirements.
•	Continuous customer feedback leads to higher satisfaction.
•	Early bug detection due to regular testing.
•	Faster delivery of functional components.
 Disadvantages:
•	Requires close collaboration, which can be time-consuming.
•	Difficult to estimate timelines and budgets accurately.
•	Not ideal for projects with strict regulatory requirements.
Waterfall Methodology
 Advantages:
•	Well-structured process with clear documentation.
•	Easier to manage for projects with strict deadlines.
•	Works well when requirements are fixed and well-understood.
Disadvantages:
•	Inflexible to changes once development starts.
•	Late testing phase increases risk of costly fixes.
•	Customers only see the final product, which may not meet evolving needs.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for projects that require flexibility, continuous feedback, and rapid iterations. It is ideal for complex, evolving, or customer-driven projects where requirements may change over time. Examples include software startups developing new applications, mobile app development, or SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms where regular updates and user feedback are essential. Agile also works well in game development, where mechanics and features are refined based on user testing.
On the other hand, Waterfall is better suited for structured projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal expected changes. It is ideal for regulated industries, government projects, and large-scale infrastructure software where documentation and compliance are critical. Examples include banking and financial systems, healthcare record management software, and military or aerospace projects that require strict validation and security measures. Construction and hardware development projects also benefit from Waterfall, as they require a fixed sequence of phases with little room for iteration.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1.	Automated Testing – Using tools like Selenium, JUnit, or PyTest helps identify bugs early and ensures consistent performance across different builds.
2.	Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) – Automating code integration and deployment (using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD) ensures early detection of errors and smoother releases.
3.	Code Reviews & Peer Testing – Regular code reviews by team members help catch errors, improve readability, and maintain coding standards.
4.	Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Writing tests before coding ensures that every feature is built with validation in mind, reducing defects.
5.	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Engaging end-users in testing ensures the software meets real-world requirements and usability expectations.
6.	Security & Performance Testing – Conducting penetration testing, load testing, and stress testing helps safeguard against vulnerabilities and performance issues.
7.	Adhering to Coding Standards – Following industry best practices and style guides (e.g., Google’s coding standards) helps maintain maintainability and reliability.
Importance of Maintaining High QA Standards
•	Prevent Costly Fixes – Catching bugs early reduces the cost of fixing them later in development.
•	Enhance User Experience – A bug-free, efficient application leads to better user satisfaction and adoption.
•	Ensure Security & Compliance – Strong QA measures protect against data breaches and ensure compliance with industry regulations.
